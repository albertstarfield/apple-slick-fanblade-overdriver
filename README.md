# Apple Silicon Fan Overdrive Repository

Welcome! This repository houses the code for my Apple Silicon PC's fan overdrive functionality. This project aims to maximize fan performance to its fullest potential. The inspiration behind this endeavor stems from a concerning observation: during seemingly light usage, such as running Minecraft with a modest 1024 Chunks rendering, my PC's CPU temperature soared to a staggering 110°C even in a well-ventilated environment. In response, I implemented a solution to overdrive the fan to 9100RPM, effectively bringing down the temperature range to a more manageable 98°C-104°C.

### Activation Instructions
To activate the overdrive feature, follow these steps:

```bash
sudo bash ./enableOverdrive.sh
```

**Disclaimer:** Please note that while this program aims to address thermal issues, I cannot accept responsibility for any damage incurred as a result of its usage. Proceed with caution and at your own risk.
